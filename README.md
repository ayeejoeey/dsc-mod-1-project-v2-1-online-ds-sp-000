# The Trend of Movies

## Introduction

There has been a trend in movies within these past 10 - 15 years. I've noticed that remakes and continued sagas/series have been a hit! It makes sense. When people love a movie, they want more! They don't want it to stop. So what do film studios do? They make more. Easy. Whether it's an old classic that has been revamped to feed the nostalgia, or whether it's a part 2 to a movie that did numbers in the box office. It's an easy block buster for major film studios. In my data analysis i will be going over how these trends make major film studios a lot of $$$$$

## Navigating the Repo

All the code is located within in the student.ipynb.

## Objectives

I will

* Explain my methodology
* Describe my materials used
* Give questions that came up during research
* Provide recommendations for further research

## Methodolgy

1. Data analyzing 
2. Data cleaning (dtype conversions, removing duplicates, lambda functions)
3. Query dataframes using pandasql
4. Seaborn use for plots



## Materials

All of the data used has been scraped from:

1. RottenTomatoes
2. IMDB
3. Box Office Mojo
4. TheMovidDB.org


# Questions


* How much in gross revenue has each movie made world-wide?
* What was the starting budget?
* How much profit did each movie make?
* How are these movies successfull?

# Recommendations

Prior to doing my data analysis i realized that there were multiple ways to go about my methods.
The project states that i must do a data analysis and create a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. Now-a-days there are platforms that stream originals and can compete with box office movies. However the way a direct-stream movie makes revenue compared to the way a box-office movie makes revenue, is not the same. With platforms such as Netflix, their source of revenue comes from price of subsriptions, streams=views, contracts with major and indie film studios. Where as box-office is film studio directly to theaters. I believe these two hold a more complex comparison and is good reason for further research and analysis.
